# Empirical analysis of the Phillips-curve
In this project I set out to analyse and to fit the 3D Phillips-curve, whereby:
* X-axis is the unemployment rate
* Y-axis is the expected inflation
* Z-axis is the actual inflation rate

**Problem:** Lack of inflation expectations before 1977

(The sources of the data are given inside of the notebook)
